Enhancement 2:

The current email format "shailesh.s[at]nic[dot]in" may appear unclear or difficult to read, especially for users unfamiliar with this representation. To enhance clarity and professionalism, it would be beneficial to use 
the standard email format "shailesh.s@nic.in" where the "@" and "." symbols are used directly, unless specifically avoiding email scraping bots. For improved readability and user experience, a more conventional format 
would be better.(https://morth.nic.in/who-is-who)

Enhancement 3:

Images can be placed better like other images on home page:
